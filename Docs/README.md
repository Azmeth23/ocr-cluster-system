# OCR Inference Platform

A production-grade Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed for high-performance text extraction on Kubernetes. Built with a microservices architecture, this platform leverages **FastAPI** as an API gateway and **KServe** for model serving using the Tesseract engine, featuring integrated GitOps continuous deployment and full-stack observability.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is built around a microservices approach focused on scalable inference, automated continuous deployment (GitOps), and deep observability:

* **API Gateway (`FastAPI`)**: The primary entry point for user requests. Manages image uploads, validates payloads, and coordinates inference calls with the model server.
* **OCR Model Server (`KServe`)**: A specialized inference engine wrapping Tesseract OCR logic. Exposes standard inference endpoints alongside Prometheus metrics on port `8080`.
* **GitOps (`ArgoCD`)**: Declarative cluster state management. Code or infrastructure updates pushed to the repository automatically synchronize with the cluster.
* **Observability Stack**: Integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** deployments for tracking real-time request rates, latency, and hardware utilization.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) 
* [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* [Helm v3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx)

## 🚀 Getting Started

###  Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Azmeth23/cluster-system-ocr.git](https://github.com/Azmeth23/cluster-system-ocr.git)
cd cluster-system-ocr

# Deployment Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the infrastructure, deploying the application, and verifying that all services are running successfully.

---

## 1. Set Up Infrastructure

Run the infrastructure setup script to configure the local Kubernetes environment and install all required dependencies.

```bash
cd infrastructure
./infrastructure-setup.sh
```

---

## 2. Deploy GitOps Resources (ArgoCD)

Apply the ArgoCD resources to enable GitOps-based deployment and synchronization.

```bash
kubectl apply -f argocd-resources.yaml
```

---

# Helm Charts & Image Management

## Package Helm Charts

Package both application Helm charts.

```bash
helm package api-gateway
helm package ocr-model
```

## Login to Docker Hub OCI Registry

Authenticate with Docker Hub before pushing the Helm charts.

```bash
helm registry login registry-1.docker.io -u azmeth07
```

## Push Helm Charts

Push the packaged charts to the OCI registry.

```bash
helm push api-gateway-0.1.0.tgz oci://registry-1.docker.io/azmeth07

helm push ocr-model-0.1.0.tgz oci://registry-1.docker.io/azmeth07
```

---

# Deploy to Minikube

## 1. Create Docker Image Pull Secret

If your Docker images are stored in a private repository, create a Kubernetes image pull secret.

```bash
kubectl create secret docker-registry dockerhub-secret \
  --docker-username=YOUR_DOCKER_USERNAME \
  --docker-password=YOUR_DOCKER_PASSWORD \
  --docker-email=YOUR_EMAIL
```

---

## 2. Create the Application Namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace ocr-app
```

---

## 3. Deploy the OCR Model Server

```bash
helm install ocr-model-server ./charts/ocr-model-server -n ocr-app
```

---

## 4. Deploy the API Gateway

```bash
helm install ocr-api-gateway ./charts/api-gateway -n ocr-app
```

---

# Verification

Verify that all application components have been deployed successfully.

## Check Running Pods

```bash
kubectl get pods -n ocr-app
```

Expected output:

- OCR Model Server pod
- API Gateway pod
- All pods should have a **Running** status.

---

## Check Services

```bash
kubectl get svc -n ocr-app
```

This command lists all Kubernetes services exposed within the `ocr-app` namespace.

---

## View Application Logs

To inspect logs for a specific pod:

```bash
kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n ocr-app
```

Replace `<pod-name>` with the name of the pod you want to monitor.

---

# Deployment Summary

The deployment process consists of:

1. Setting up the infrastructure.
2. Deploying ArgoCD GitOps resources.
3. Packaging Helm charts.
4. Publishing charts to the OCI registry.
5. Creating the Docker image pull secret.
6. Creating the application namespace.
7. Deploying the OCR Model Server.
8. Deploying the FastAPI API Gateway.
9. Verifying pods, services, and application logs.
